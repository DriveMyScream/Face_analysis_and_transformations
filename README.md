This comprehensive project encompasses a wide range of facial analysis and image manipulation tasks. It includes tasks like beauty classification, facial expressions, face shape recognition, and predicting BMI, age, and gender. Additionally, it deals with face feature estimation, accurate human face detection, obstruction detection, and clearance. The project also includes tasks like facial sketch generation, super-resolution enhancement, synthetic human face generation, and face image captioning, showcasing its versatility in image analysis and manipulation.

1) Facial Beauty Classification: App rates user faces as 'Average' or 'Beautiful' and offers personalized beauty tips. We employed various model architectures: LeNet, AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet18, Inception-V1, MobileNet-V2, EfficientNet, & an ensemble model. LeNet, a simple & compact model, remarkably achieved 80% accuracy. We utilized TensorBoard for experiment tracking.
2) Emoji Suggestions Based on User Facial Expression: App categorizes user expressions into 8 categories and suggests emojis accordingly. We fine-tuned pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet50, Inception-V3, MobileNet, and EfficientNetB0, and use data augmentation techniques like Mixup and CutMix. The MobileNet model achieved a top-5 accuracy of 92%, experiments tracked via TensorBoard.
3) Face Shape Recognition: App categorizes user faces into 5 groups & shares interesting facts. We implement a Vision Transformer (ViT) model but by fine-tuning a pretrained ViT model from Hugging Face we are able to achieve an 80% top-3 accuracy. Experiments tracked using TensorBoard.
4) Predicting BMI, Age, and Gender: App estimates your BMI, age, and gender based on your face. If your BMI falls outside a certain range, we offer tips. We used a single input, multiple output ResNet101 model, achieving a 98% recall for gender, 6.511 MSE for age, and 3.891 MSE for BMI.
5) Face Features Estimation: App measures the percentage of your face occupied by eyebrows, eyes, nose, lips, and mouth. We employed a U-Net image segmentation model with Albumentations for data augmentation, achieving an F1 score of 0.56% and a Jaccard score of 0.433%.
6) Accurate Human Face Detection: To correctly detect a human face inside a photo. We employ a MobileNetV2 model to predict bounding box coordinates with the use of Albumentations for data augmentation, we achieve a 0.404% IOU score.
7) Detecting Face Obstructions: Identify obstructions like glasses or masks on a human face we employed anomaly detection Variational Autoencoder based VGG16 model. If the reconstruction error exceeds a set threshold, it signals the presence of these obstructions.
8) Clearing Facial Obstructions: To improve user facial clarity when there are obstructions like glasses or masks, we utilize a pair of cycle GAN models with two discriminators and generators. Achieving a minimum loss of 5.40 for generation and 0.49 for discrimination.
9) Facial Sketch Generation: To turn a user's face into a sketch, we try models: a generator based on U-Net, a basic discriminator in a Pix2Pix model, and an autoencoder-driven U-Net model. Among these, the autoencoder-based model achieves a min loss of 4.2e-07 for gen & 2.8e-06 for discrimination.
10) Super-Resolution Enhancement for User Faces: To enhance the quality of a user's face image, we use a generator and discriminator based on ResNet in an SRGAN model. This makes it simple to transform a low-resolution picture into a high-resolution achieving 0.042 and 0.139 dis loss and gen loss.
11) Synthetic Human Face Generation: Creating Realistic 256-Dimensional Nonexistent Human Faces which look like the user. We employ a Progressive growing generator and discriminator model, achieving a minimum loss of 5.79 for generation and -3.43 for discrimination.
12) Face Image Captioning: To generate a summary from your face image we employ an EfficientNetB0-Transformer based image caption generator model with achieving a loss of 11.07 and an accuracy of 0.4167.
